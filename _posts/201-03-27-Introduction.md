Let me introduce myself. My name is Martin Colahan. I am a chemical engineer with a specialty in corrosion engineering and corrosion research. I also have a passion for programming and data science which started from my need to organize my research data as I worked on my Master's degree. I also really enjoy making stuff. As a maker, I tend to be a jack of all trades, master of none kind of person. I know how to make things using a variety of techniques including woodworking, metalworking, machining, etc. 

This post will be the first of many posts which I intend to showcase my various projects, discuss my thoughts on random topics, and whatever else I feel is blog worthy. Most of the content will focus on projects I intend to showcase to boost my professional career, but I'll also likely blog about something I've made out in the shop or discuss my thoughts on the news of the day. 

Happy Reading!
